The NATS team will be hosting a webinar on **Wednesday, October 19th at 11AM Pacific / 2PM Eastern**.

This webinar will feature Ryan Neal, the Head of Infrastructure at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify is a platform for deploying high-performance websites and applications, serving up billions pageviews monthly for sites like: Uber, Vice Media, and Wikia to name a few.

Ryan will discuss why they selected NATS, his experience with NATS for Netlify's data logging and control plane (for example using Logrus with a [NATS hook](https://github.com/netlify/messaging/blob/master/nats_logrus_hook.go), a connector for using [NATS with Elastic](https://github.com/netlify/elastinats), etc.).

We will do QnA at the end - so bring a few questions!

Looking forward to you joining, and hearing any questions you may have!
